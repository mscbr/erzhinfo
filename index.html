			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<br />
			<p>Hailing from the Polish city of Krakow, ERZH (aka Maciej Ścibor) was forged in the city’s bustling and vibrant underground electronic scene. Beginning as a DJ for underground raves in the cellars of the city’s abandoned hotels, it was in 2015 that ERZH broke out and began organising his parties. Starting off at the cult venue Bomba, Erzh made a name for himself in the local techno clubs of Krakow, where he was a guest performer of the Deep Impact collective and performing guest sets on the local radio station (Off Radio Kraków) Essentia Electronica. 
			<br /><br />
			In 2016 ERZH joined Nashton Records - a record label and a collective of artists from Lyon and Krakow. Hosting local events that played hard and fast with their techno sounds, they hosted such artists and producers as Dax J and I Hate Models, alongside the artists and DJs from the label. After the success of these events, ERZH moved to Reykjavik, Iceland at the end of 2016 where he currently performs and DJs in the local electronic music scene.
